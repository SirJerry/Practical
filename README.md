# Practical
Jerry's DIY phy

So the whole idea of the project is trying to make some physics practicals better with the help of technology.
What I’m working on is using Arduino to measure the speed of a DIY car without a stopwatch but the ultrasonic sensor. 
So in physics practicals, there’s always one factor that changes as you know. Here, what I would be changing is the size of the wheels, to show that bigger wheels = more speed.

I am using the wall as a reference point, so I push the car,  and the sensor starts reading when the car is about 20cm away from the wall and stops about 12cm away from the wall to get the time taken to cover that 8cm distance
